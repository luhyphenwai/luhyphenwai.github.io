Howdy, Iâ€™m Lu-Wai Wong, and Iâ€™m running for Pres!
Long story short, Iâ€™m a CS student that wants to give you events you want, and boost your career first and foremost. Quick example -- Iâ€™ve founded a game development club in the past, teaching students how to make games, and joining game jams together!
If Iâ€™m elected, my goals are to focus on:
Socials that people will LOVE (lan tournaments anyone???, free food???)
Events that will help YOU as a CS student EXPAND YOUR PORTFOLIOS, teaching you about web dev, game dev, AI, and everything that weâ€™re all interested in. 
Hosting networking and career focused events to help us all get jobs (the job market is tough rn ðŸ˜­)
And anything else youâ€™re all interested in! I want to focus on listening to YOUR input and giving you events youâ€™d actually use in your career!
